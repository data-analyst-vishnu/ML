# ML Web Application

This project is an interactive web application designed to demonstrate the **K-Means Clustering Algorithm**. The application allows users to visually explore the clustering process through dynamic visualizations and simulations. It includes detailed steps of the algorithm (Initialization, Assignment, Update, Repeat) and interactive features such as data point generation and centroid manipulation.

## Features
- **Interactive Playground**: Users can interact with the clustering process by adding centroids manually or auto-generating them.
- **Visualization**: Real-time visual updates for centroid assignment and updates during iterations.
- **Educational Steps**:
  - **Initialization**: Randomly initialize centroids.
  - **Assignment**: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.
  - **Update**: Recalculate centroid positions based on cluster assignments.
  - **Repeat**: Iterate until convergence or a maximum number of iterations is reached.
- **Elbow Method Visualization**: Helps determine the optimal number of clusters (K).
- **Fully Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes for a seamless user experience.
